            <h2>DEFEND YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY.<br>PROTECT YOURSELF ONLINE.</h2>
            <p>As we enter the digital age, we are constantly letting convenience comfort us at the cost of our well-being, safety, and privacy. Intrusive online surveillance and cybercrimes are on the rise to an extent that pushes far beyond the public's view. We are here to spread awareness and support for this cause.</p>

            <h2 id="purpose">Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>The services we use and the information we share online hold us hostage by the hands of massive corporations. Part of this is proven by data brokers, for example, that create detailed profiles from our personal information that they purchased from services we use. They use this stalker-level amount of information to manipulate us in their favor, and arguably, a legal loophole is created when processing it. Our abused privacy and security, unfortunately, is not limited to this. Many things we rely on in our daily life like our phone numbers, emails, computers, banking services, and personal identity are all at risk online. This isn't a conspiracy theory, in fact, it can be seen in many services' Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policies that we never read. But despite the heavyweight grip held against most people in corporate surveillance, anyone can take steps to protect themselves, their business, or others.<br><br>We aim to provide a productive space for those concerned about protecting their online privacy and security at no cost, regardless of preference or technological capabilities.</p>
            <h2>Why should I care about my privacy? I have nothing to hide.</h2>
            <p>This is a common misinterpretation between privacy and secrecy. Other common arguments are "I'm not some famous celebrity or wanted by the government" or "Why should I care if companies sell my data to advertisers? Wouldn't it be better to see ads that actually interest me?"<br><br>Would you let someone watch what you do all day if you had nothing to hide? Or is it better when much powerful corporations do that instead? Privacy is not just about hiding illegal or embarrassing activities. It's about protecting your personal information, preferences, and autonomy. Without privacy, your data can be used to manipulate your decisions, shape your behavior, and potentially even discriminate against you. Even if you have nothing to hide, you should still value your right to control how your information is used.<br><br>Also, regardless of who you might be to the rest of the world, online surveillance and data collection affects everyone, not just high-profile individuals or those with criminal intentions. Information harvested from you can be used to target you with ads, influence your opinions, or even make decisions about your eligibility for various services, such as loans or jobs. The impact extends beyond government interest to encompass corporate interests as well.<br><br>It should be noted that not only is your information used to create ads to influence you to purchase products, it is also used to manipulate your thinking. For instance, social media companies use your information to target your insecurities and desires to keep you attached to their platform. Your ideologies, especially political preferences, are also highly at risk and can be subliminally altered by means of targeted advertising.</p>
            <h2>So what am I supposed to do? Abandon all technology and live in the woods?</h2>
            <p>You could, but that is obviously way too extreme for most people. Privacy and cybersecurity is a journey, not a goal. Each step to protect yourself usually comes in with a trade-off of convenience. It is up to you to decide what type of balance suits your interests best. We recommended to prioritize your needs in the order of security, privacy, and anonymity. Remember that even if you have highly exposed yourself to the internet, there are still things you can do to protect your digital life.<br><br>In short, security refers to the measures taken to protect data, systems, and individuals from unauthorized access, attacks, or harm. It's about safeguarding information from both external and internal threats, including as scammers, viruses, and data breaches. This is usually where most people want to protect themselves and where most is at risk.<br><br>Privacy refers to the right of individuals to control their personal information and to decide how, when, and to what extent that information is shared with others. This deals with protecting your personal life, communication, and the ability to conduct activities without the prying eyes of unnecessary surveillance.<br><br>Anonymity is the state of being unknown or unidentifiable in a particular context. This expands on privacy where you take defensive measures to avoid being tracked on the internet or being unfavorably personally identified.<br><br>It is also important to acknowledge the scope outside these three concerns, such as your dependencies to certain services, your physical security, and the surveillance used outside of the online world.</p>
            <h2>So what does OSSSDA do?</h2>
            <p>The journey to privacy and security can be a very confusing and technologically-involved one. That is why this club was created, to nurture a strong community of individuals that help support each other in improving cybersecurity. We aim to spread awareness of the issues regarding our online privacy and provide resources for those looking to protect themselves. Becoming accepted as a member, however, means that you can collaborate with us as a club.</p>
